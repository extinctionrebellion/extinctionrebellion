## About Extinction Rebellion (XR)

Extinction Rebellion is a movement of non-violent, mass direct action of civil disobedience for the climate.
More info on https://rebellion.earth

It is a self-organized organization. There is no hierarchy. We split into working groups that have mandates.
See this [video about Power, Decision Making & Strategy in Extinction Rebellion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsh5eWVksCE) and on [the 10 principles of XR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6se6c5qvuV4).

## Why use Github?

We all have something to contribute to the movement. 
Right now, a lot of the rebellion is using spreadsheets and lacks dedicated tools. 
This has been good enough for now but it doesn't scale; it's a mess.
As the movement grows, we need to develop dedicated tools.

We have a GitLab instance (https://code.organise.earth), but most open source developers are on Github. We want to ensure that we can tap into this great community.

## Current stack

List of the tools that the movement is currently using:

**Open Source**
- [Mattermost](https://mattermost.com): slack alternative
- [Discourse](https://www.discourse.org/): self hosted forum softare
- [Signal](https://signal.org/): secure messaging app
- [Framadate](https://framadate.org/): doodle.com alternative
- [MailTrain](https://mailtrain.org/): self hosted newsletter app
- [NextCloud](https://nextcloud.com): google drive alternative
- [GitBook](https://gitbook.com): documentation repository
- [GitLab](https://gitlab.com): self hosted github alternative
- [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com): transparent expense management and fundraising

**Non Open Source**
- [Framapad](https://framapad.org/): google doc alternative for real time editing
- [Basecamp](https://basecamp.com): project management software
- [WhatsApp](https://whatsapp.com): messaging app
- Google Docs / Spreadsheets
- [Xero](https://xero.com): accounting software

Contributing to the open source tools list is already a great way to contribute to the movement!
For the non open source tools, finding ways to connect them with other more open source tools would be useful. 

Beyond those tools, the movement is also making extensive use of social platforms (mainly Facebook, Instagram, Twitter).

## What is needed?

Our absolute priority is to get as many rebels willing to participate in direct actions of civil disobedience for the climate emergency. Everything we do should be to support them and the organization.

### Tools for outreach and onboarding

The immediate need that some rebels have already started working on is a tool for local chapters to manage a database of rebels (RebelsManager). Right now people use spreadsheets and it is not ideal.

### Tools for open and transparent finance
The other area where spreadsheets are heavily used is finance. On top of not being ideal and error prone, it is also difficult to maintain transparency.

A couple of local chapters use [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com) (see https://opencollective.com/extinctionrebellion) but in its current form, it doesn't work in all countries (it's limited by [countries where Stripe operates](https://stripe.com/global)). Given that it's open source, we could fork the software to meet the needs of XR and offer it for free to the local chapters.
The main XR UK is using [Xero](https://xero.com).

### Tools for documentation
As the organization continues to grow, more and more knowledge is being created. We should ensure that it not lost.
There is already a gazillion of google docs left and right but no single point that bring them all together.

It would be great to have a wiki for this.
In the meantime, we have set up a GitBook on docs.opencollective.com/extinctionrebellion (ideally we should move it to docs.organise.earth once ready). The associated GitHub repo is [here](https://github.com/extinctionrebellion/docs).

## How to contribute?

All are welcome who want to adhere to [our principles and values](https://github.com/extinctionrebellion/extinctionrebellion/blob/master/principles.md).

We are still figuring out what would be the best process to contribute.
For now, the best is probably to introduce yourself by posting an issue to this repo.
Tell us about you, your skills and what you would love to do.

With love and rage!
